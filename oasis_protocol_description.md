This smart contract is called "HeroesBattleArena" and it is an ERC1155 token contract that allows users to mint and trade virtual heroes. Let's go through the functionality of each function and how they interact.

1. `DemoOracle` is an interface that defines the functions for retrieving price data from an external oracle. It includes a `getReferenceData` function that returns the price data for a given base/quote pair.

2. `DemoOracle` is a contract that implements the `IStdReference` interface. It has a `savePrice` function that saves the price data for a given base/quote pair, and a `getPrice` function that returns the saved price.

3. `ERC1155Burnable` is an abstract contract that extends the ERC1155 token contract and allows token holders to burn their own tokens and those that they have been approved to use. It includes a `burn` function for burning a single token and a `burnBatch` function for burning multiple tokens.

4. `Strings` is a library that provides string manipulation functions. It includes a `toString` function for converting a `uint256` to its ASCII decimal representation, and a `toHexString` function for converting a `uint256` to its ASCII hexadecimal representation.

5. `HeroesBattleArena` is the main contract that extends the ERC1155 token contract and includes the functionality for minting and trading virtual heroes. It has a struct called `PartWithPrice` that represents a hero part with its name, price, and herotype.

6. The contract has a `demoOracle` variable of type `DemoOracle` that is used to interact with the external oracle for retrieving price data.

7. The contract has several state variables including `name` for storing the name of the contract, `allParts` for storing all the hero parts with their prices, `partIds` for storing the IDs of all the hero parts, and `earlyHeroesSupply`, `olympHeroesSupply`, `nordHeroesSupply`, and `freeStonesSupply` for storing the supplies of different types of heroes and free stones.

8. The contract has variables `earlyHeroesNumber`, `olympHeroesNumber`, and `nordHeroesNumber` for keeping track of the number of minted heroes of each type.

9. The contract has a boolean variable `reentrancyGuardFlag` that is used as a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls.

10. The constructor of the contract takes a URL and a `DemoOracle` instance as parameters and initializes the `name`, `demoOracle`, and supply variables.

11. The contract has a `addPart` function that allows the contract owner to add a new hero part with its name, ID, price, and herotype.

12. The contract has a `getPartById` function that takes an ID as a parameter and returns the name and price of the hero part with that ID.

13. The contract has a `getPartByName` function that takes a name as a parameter and returns the price of the hero part with that name.

14. The contract has a `setURI` function that allows the contract owner to set the URI for the token metadata.

15. The contract has a `mint` function that allows users to mint heroes by providing the name of the hero part and the amount to mint. The function checks if the user has already reached the maximum amount of free stones, verifies the value sent by the user, and mints the requested amount of heroes based on their type and availability. The function also transfers the value sent to the contract owner.

16. The contract has several functions for changing the supplies of different types of heroes and free stones. These functions can only be called by the contract owner.

17. The contract has a `getPrice` function that returns the current price of the base/quote pair "ROSE/USD" by calling the `getPrice` function of the `demoOracle` contract.

18. The contract has a `withdrawBalance` function that allows the contract owner to withdraw the balance of the contract.

Overall, this smart contract allows users to mint and trade virtual heroes based on their availability and prices. The contract interacts with an external oracle to retrieve price data and uses it to calculate the price of heroes in different currencies.
